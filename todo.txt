- continue to create interfaces for data from stats-API
^^>> specifically all the different types from using modifiers on team & game api calls

- add base type with copyright property
- change date properties from string to date?

- utilize shared module

- update datasources paradigm
- update/improve logger-service/module (possibly make shared npm module for nestjs backend projects)

Remaining Logical Modules:
- people (aka player) (finish)
- schedule
- standings (add to team module?)
  - standing types
- draft
- stats
  - stat types
  - team stats
- game (finish)
  - game types
  - game status
  - play types?
  - live feed (+ time ranges)
    - box score
    - linescore
    - content
- roster? (if used in multiple schema stitches)
